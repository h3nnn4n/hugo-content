Hey there. Currently I am working on a project which requires a somewhat peculiar setup. 
I am using a programming framework for a project that only runs on windows. While wine on linux kinda
works, it was a few issues and is too unreliable. As such, I am either required to work directly on
an actual windows machine or to run a virtual machine. I chose the later.

As for now, my main workstation is a macbook pro. While it can handle the virtual box with some pain,
it would make the system much slower, specially while I am at working running a heavy-ish app. Moreso, the
project in question requires a reliable uptime. With that in mind, I decided to use my old 2013 desktop running linux.
It has an overclocked i5-3570k and 24Gb of ram which has been running pretty much non stop since I bought it.
Firstly I set up an headless vitual machine using VirtualBox. Then auto start on boot was configured. Thus, if somehow the
machine shuts down/reboots, it would automatically start the virtual machine again on boot. In the virtual machine I configured
RealVCN on the windows client and with it I could easily work on my project on windows from my confortable macbook pro.

So far so good. But this isnt a post about a cool setup. It is a post about a kernel panic and hours of debugging.
It all started with an system wide update that I decided to do. As usual, I though to myself "Hmmm, do I really need to update right now
and risk downtime?". The answer was an obvious "No". The system was relativelly fresh (a few weeks, maybe months). Nevertheless, I went
ahead and decided to do it. After more than a decade using Linux, seldomly I had issues when doing a full system update.
It is not unheard of. It still happens once in a while, but what were the odds of it happening right now? I went ahead and started the update.
The list was relativelly big. I saw a kernel update, along with a lot of random packages and virtual box. After thinking "Hmm, this could go wrong"
I decided to run the update anyways. The packages were downloaded, installed. The `initrd` was generated, `grub-mkconfig` was run. Everything was ready.
The machine was scheduled to reboot at 2 am. I continued to work on my windows project for a couple of hours before going to sleep.

The next day I work up, did some errands and ~went~ started to work. After work I tried to connect with the VNC to the virtual machine.
The VNC server was off. "Weird", I thought. I tried to remotelly log to my linux machine but it didnt work. I rebooted the machine and
got the same response. The "I told you so" thought crossed my mind. The desktop it pretty much just a pile of harddrives and SDDs laying
on top of my desk with a naked motherboard and the power supply. It has no keyboard or monitor. I quickly fetched both and plugged them.
I got no image nor response from the keyboard. "This gonna be fun" I thought. The machine was rebooted, the motherboard manufacturer logo
appeared, then grub, then a black screen with the blinking cursor on the top right followed by a kernel panic. The first thing that
came to mind was a couple of swear words in portuguese followed by the image of an old man laughing (that would be my mental image of Murphy).

First thing I tried to do was use the fallback image that is automatically generated with the previous version. I got a kernel panic again.
After some consideration I think that on my last upgrade I did not reboot the machine. If so, it is possible that the old state was already
"unbootable". But I am not sure. I then tried botting another linux that I had installed on a separate disk. I got some grub error about a disk
with some uuid not being found. "That is what you get by not testing things until you need them", I thought.  After this I decided to try again next
day, which was going to be saturday.

Next day, I went on to get things work again.
First I used an hardware analisys tool that I had setup on grub, and was still working. A quick look around and I found that one of my hard drives
has a negative size. "Bummer", I thought. The computer was turned off and I removed everything except and SSD with the root. I rebotted and got an
error saying that no bootable device was found. Then I remembered that I was using grub from another disk, which had my previous instalation.

Next step was getting an bootable linux pendrive to setup grub again. I tried at least 5 times with my macbook to get it working but I could not.
No idea why. I am relativelly fresh on using Apple's OS. As a fallback I got an 10 year old laptop, which had a somewhat prehistoric version of
linux, but at least it was working. The pendrive was setup and I booted the desktop using it. First thing was to setup grub and generate a configuration file.
The computer was restarted and Kernel Panic again. "I guess the issue isnt the harddrive".

My next step was then to chroot into the broken linux and run an update again. "Maybe it was a borked package and it got fixed". Only a couple of
packages of small importance got updated. I rebooted again and kernel panic again. Everytime the kernel panic backtrace was different, so I could not
easilly pinpoint what was causing it. The list of loaded modules had way to much stuff loaded. A few google queries after I found nothing useful.
Then, I had the idea to remove the `quiet` flag from grub. The config file was updated and the computer rebooted. Lots of white lines appeared and kernel panic
again, very fast. I rebooted a couple of times but I could not see what was the last thing before the kernel panic. I then recorded the screen with my
phone. Watching the video I saw that docker was the last thing before the kernel panic. I chrooted and disabled the docker service that was being started
on boot. Still kernel panic.

Trying to pinpoint what was causing it wasnt going very well, so I decied to take large steps in change trying to get the system to work again. When it started
working I could slowly add things back until the culprit was found. I listed all the services enabled on boot. There were only half a dozen or so.
I disabled them all. Two were vpn related, there was virtual box, and some other unregognized services. I rebooted and voala. I got a login screen. Finally
I had some progress.

From there, my main suspect was virtual box. So I reenabled everything except for it. Rebooted and login screen again. Looks like virtual box
was somewhow the troublemaker. No idea why. Well, virtual box was the reason I was so urgent to get the machine working again.

My linux distro of preference has a daily snapshot of the repository, which can be referenced by the package manager. I pointed the repository
to 1 week ago and downgraded a whole lot of packages, rebuild the initramfs, updated grub, enabled virtualbox and rebooted. Boom, kernel panic again.
Then I pointed it 1 month ago and repeated the process. Now it worked.

From when then problem first started until I got it fixed, it was about 8 dead hours of free time, including some of my weekend. And for what?
Upgrading the system for the sake of it? Not worth it. Leason learned. There is a saying that I learned from my time in the army, it goes like this:
"O trauma Ã© o melhor professor". In english it would be somewhat like "Trauma is the best teacher". Indeed. Leasons we learn the hard way are
the ones we keep more easily. Leason learned. Hopefully I tend to learn through more efficient and less frustrating ways.

Well, here are some keypoints from all this:
1) Beware of Murphy's law
2) Dont upgrade for fun
3) Check if your fallbacks are working
4) Know your system and what it has to offer
5) When debugging try to get the system back to an working state asap

This is what I had to share. Stay safe.
