Hey there. I am Renan S Silva, also known as h3nnn4n or bacon_unleased /
bacon_unleashed, depending on where you know me from. I recived my bachelor
degree on Computer Science from the
[State University of Santa Catarina](https://www.udesc.br/)
on august 2017. After that I started a master's degree in applied computing
[Applied Computing](https://www.udesc.br/cct/ppgca) working with the Ab Initio
protein structure problem.

Currently I work full time as a Software Engineer on
[JobScore](https://www.jobscore.com/), mainly on backend and some data intesive
tasks.

I am a man of many hobbies. I have a strong passion for puzzles, specially
twisty ones, like the Rubik's Cube. I love cats and coffee. I play drums and do
origami. I like biking and hiking. I love artificial intelligence, optimization
and machine learning (looks like everyone nowdays does).

Here is a random picture of my puzzle collection (the cat is a specially hard
one).
