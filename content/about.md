Hey there. I am Renan S Silva, also known as h3nnn4n or bacon_unleased,
depending on where you know me from. I recived my bachelor degree on Computer
Science from the [State University of Santa Catarina](https://www.udesc.br/) on
august 2017.  Currently I work full time as a Software Engineer on
[JobScore](https://www.jobscore.com/) while also pursuing my masters degree on
[Applied Computing](https://www.udesc.br/cct/ppgca), where I work with the ab
init protein structure problem.


I am a man of many hobbies. I have a strong passion for puzzles, specially
twisty ones, like the Rubik's Cube. I love cats and coffee. I play drums and do
origami. I like biking and hiking. I love artificial intelligence, optimization
and machine learning (looks like everyone nowdays does).
