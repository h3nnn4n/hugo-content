### Shootaroo

Fast paced game with a heavy focus on hand-eye coordination and ambidexterity.
The player must defend agaisnt a never ending onslaught of abstract enemies and
try to get the highest score possible.

Will be published to Steam by august. Check
[shootaroo.xyz](https://shootaroo.xyz) for more.

This is my first attempt at a comercial game. It was born out of a self
challenge to publish a game. Dispite the game simplicity, getting it ready for
publishing helped me to develop several skills and learn new things.

### Mustache jellyfish are evil and will destroy your ship

You wake up alone in your ship. The crew is missing and without them you can't
properly control the ship. Defend your ship against an infinite horde of evil
mustache jellyfish.
